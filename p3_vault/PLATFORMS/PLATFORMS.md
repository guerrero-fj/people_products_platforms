# PLATFORMS Overview
 [[PLATFORMS]]  are all the spaces where [[PEOPLE]] come together to discuss ideas and create [[PRODUCTS]]. Presence in these [[PLATFORMS]] can be virtual/digital (e.g., [[Tech_platforms]]) or in person (e.g., [[Org_platforms]]). I call these [[PLATFORMS]] not only because these virtual/physical spaces provide a space for interactions to occur, but also because people's location on the space depends on their power and privilege.

Platforms can be used to use multiple [[Tools]] and to assign [[Tasks]]. Some of these tasks are organized in a systematic way to become [[Workflows]].
