# PLATFORMS Overview
 [[PLATFORMS]]  are all the spaces where [[PEOPLE]] come together to discuss ideas and create [[PRODUCTS]]. Presence in these [[PLATFORMS]] can be virtual/digital (e.g., [[Tech_platforms]]) or in person (e.g., [[Org_platforms]]). I call these [[PLATFORMS]] not only because these virtual/physical spaces provide a space for interactions to occur. 


 to develop [[PRODUCTS]] by creating and completing multiple [[Tasks]], using different [[Tools]] and by sharing [[Workflows]]
